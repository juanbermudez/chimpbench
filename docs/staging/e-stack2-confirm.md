# Integrated confirm of the provisional candidates (integrator, registered 2 October 2026 before its run)

## Why
Each Track E stage was judged on its own reference. This run puts every provisional candidate together once, to
measure how close the emergent model now gets to the field against today's model (B) and the reference stack (R), and
whether the pieces stay viable together. Nothing goes on by default from it (Track E sequencing rule).

## The stack S2
R (handoff §3: `energyLedger`, `ledgerGrowSurplus`, `ledgerNightNurse`, `ledgerInfantIntake`, `ledgerNurseBout`,
`ledgerGrowPotential`, `ledgerDigesta`, `ledgerDrive`, `rhythmSleep`, `rhythmHeat`, `endoStates`, `endoEscalate`,
`endoRedirect`, `endoFast`, `endoRainDisplay`) plus:
- E1h `ledgerFoodEnergyFix` (keep conditional on the gut; its real effect is the activity budget);
- E1i `ledgerSatiationReserve`, `ledgerLactGut` (null under the strict viability line, but the only configuration
  with corrected food energy and no starvation; `ledgerLactGut` flagged: size matched to its load by construction);
- E4c `callValue` (confirmed provisional keep candidate);
- the E2f package as validated on its reference R0: `rhythmCircadian`, `departRace`, `nestLightDecide`, `sleepChimp`,
  `rhythmFreeNight`, `nestCompany`, `nestAudience`, `darkCost` (night safety confirmed on 5 seeds);
- E4f `preyKanyawara` (site-matched input, [L]).
Left out: E4d `endoRhythm` (recorded, removes nothing), E4e `huntValue` (held off: two errors cancelling), E3's switches
(not confirmed), `ledgerWildCostMult` (sensitivity tool).

## Runs
Field profile, rules policy, seeds 48, 7, 21, 5, 11, 30-day burn-in + 60 days, from `bench-run` at the commit that adds
this file: `e-bench --confirm` (S2), `energy-diagnose` (S2), `rhythm-metrics` (S2), one at a time, `--workers` 2 when
the load is under 8, else 1.

## Judgement
- Benchmark: S2's fitted and held-out sums (with and without T-HUN-4 and T-BRD-1) against the means of B's and of R's
  four confirm realizations (e-noise.md amendment 2; z with SD × √1.25), and the row-by-row picture against both.
- Prescriptions: S2 against B (135) and R (103).
- Viability: no starvation death; reserve slopes by class (the 0.05%/day line reported, as in E1i §8); night safety
  (adults out of a nest ≤ 3.3% of the night, T-RHY-5 ≤ 0.033, no night death).

Expected (integrator, before the run): prescriptions about 90 (high confidence); no starvation death (moderate);
mothers −0.1 to −0.3% of the store a day (low); night safety holds (low to moderate: interactions untested); fitted
below R's mean by 0.5–1.5 (moderate, the activity rows); held-out within noise of B's mean (low).
